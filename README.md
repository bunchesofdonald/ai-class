# AI-Class

I'm taking the stanford AI class (http://ai-class.org). Even though they require no programming, I decided that the best way to learn was to actually implement the algorithms that are discussed in the lectures.

So this is my repository for those projects. Most will probably be hosted on chrispickett.me, so watch the blog there if you want to know more.
