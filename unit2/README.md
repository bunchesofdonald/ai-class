# AI-Class - Unit 2: Problem Solving

Most of unit 2 deals with searching a graph and the various algorithms to do so. The example used in the lectures is that of cities in romania, and finding a path from one city to another.

- route_finder.py - Python implementation of a graph search, which uses the same data as the lectures use.
- route_finder.html - HTML front-end for js visualization.  
- map.js - JS Classes for dealing with map objects, such as cities and roads.  
- romania.js - Creates romania.cities and romania.roads which are used as the graph to search and for display.  
- route_finder.js - The workhorse, (should probably be split up more and could use some re-factoring), handles user interaction, as well as actually searching the graph (romania).
